"""Windows WinUSB binding via the bundled wdi-simple.exe (libwdi).

:func:`install_winusb` shells out to a vendored, *unsigned* ``wdi-simple.exe`` under UAC
elevation (``ShellExecuteExW`` ``"runas"``) to bind a card to WinUSB so libusb can open it.
:func:`restore_driver` reverses that: it finds the WinUSB/libusb driver bound to the card
(SetupAPI, the same enumeration libwdi uses) and ``pnputil /delete-driver … /uninstall``s
it, so Windows re-points the card to its native Wi-Fi driver (still in the driver store,
no pre-bind snapshot needed). The lookup keys off the *service* (WinUSB/libusbK/libusb0),
so it also rolls back Zadig's bindings, not just ours.

Both actions are privileged and block until the elevated process exits, so they MUST run
off the Textual event loop (the splash offloads them to a thread). The exe is built from
pinned upstream libwdi (see ``bin/PROVENANCE.md``); because it is unsigned, this path is
gated behind explicit user action in the splash.
