# WEP attacks (and cracking)

> **For agents, not humans.** WEP-attack design notes + HW-verified protocol reference for the `wep/` code.

Scope doc for porting `aireplay-ng -1/-3/-4/-5` + an `aircrack-ng`-equivalent PTW key recovery into wifit3. Native Python on top of `WlanInterface`, same shape as the existing PMKID / SAE / decloak attacks.

## Why

Early plans said "skip WEP — outdated". Flipped 2026-05-22: WEP networks still occasionally surface (legacy IoT setups, ancient routers left running) and seeing one in Scanner with no attack available is the wrong end of the wifit3 promise. Modern isn't the only target.

## Tool taxonomy (refresher)

| `aircrack-ng` tool | wifit3 equivalent |
|---|---|
| `airodump-ng` — passive RX, IV collection | already-present Scanner / Focus, extended with IV dedup + count |
| `aireplay-ng` — active TX, IV generation | new — this directory |
| `aircrack-ng` — PTW / FMS / KoreK cracker | MVP shells out; full-native ports PTW |
| `airdecap-ng` — post-crack pcap decrypt | one-shot utility, not a TUI feature |

## Phase 1 — IV capture (~2 days, first M)

Listen for WEP-encrypted data frames on a target BSSID. Extract the 3-byte IV (offset 24 in the encrypted body, immediately after MAC header). Dedup + count uniques. Stash to either:
- in-memory ring buffer (live counter in Focus), and / or
- a `.cap` / `.ivs` file on disk for downstream cracking.

No TX required. Builds entirely on the existing parser RX path.

UI: WEP-encrypted AP in Scanner gets a `(W)` marker. Focus on it shows "X unique IVs / Y total frames" counter, ticking up live.

## Phase 2 — IV generation attacks (~2 weeks total)

Mirror `aireplay-ng`'s option flags so the existing documentation / muscle memory transfers cleanly.

### `-1` Fake authentication (~1 day) — prerequisite
Open-system authentication + association as a forged client so the AP accepts our future injections. Builds on the auth / assoc machinery already in `pmkid_harvest.py`. Lands first.

### `-3` ARP replay (~1–2 days) — the workhorse
Listen for an ARP request (broadcast WEP data frame, distinctive 68 / 86-byte size depending on padding). Once captured, replay it on a loop. The AP echoes back ARP replies — each carries a fresh IV. **Most WEP networks fall to this attack alone** given an existing client on the network.

### `-5` Fragmentation [Bittau 2005] (~3–5 days)
Inject fragmented frames with known plaintext (LLC / SNAP header — always the same prefix). The AP's response, when reassembled, reveals up to ~1500 bytes of keystream. With keystream we forge arbitrary packets — typically a fake ARP request to feed back into `-3`. Useful when no client is on the network to source the seed ARP.

### `-4` ChopChop [KoreK 2004] (~3–5 days)
Byte-by-byte decryption of one captured packet via the AP as an ICV oracle. Strip the last byte, XOR in a guess, send. AP either acks (correct guess) or doesn't. 256 guesses per byte max. Recovers plaintext + keystream without ever knowing the key. Slower than fragmentation; useful as a fallback when fragmentation doesn't elicit a response.

## Phase 3 — Cracking

### MVP path (~½ day)
Shell out to a system-installed `aircrack-ng` against the dump file, parse its stdout for the recovered key, surface in the UI. External dependency, but the user-visible flow is identical to the native path.

### Full-native path (~1 week)
Port PTW [Pyshkin / Tews / Weinmann 2007]. Needs ~40–85 k unique IVs for 104-bit recovery. Breakdown:
- RC4 inner loop: ~20 lines
- IV → key-byte vote tabulation: ~200 lines
- Search + key-candidate testing: ~200 lines
- FMS + KoreK fallback for stubborn cases: another ~500 lines

Net: ~500–1000 LoC of careful crypto math. Self-contained; no external `aircrack-ng` required.

## Milestones

```

```

M1–M4 in ~1 week of focused work lands the visible feature. M5–M8 close it out in another ~2–3 weeks.

## Testing

User has a box of ~2017-era routers — many of those still support WEP. Plan: dedicate one as a permanent WEP test target, leave it running while developing. WEP-active networks on the wider neighborhood scan are rare but possible (legacy IoT, forgotten setup APs).

## Open questions before M1 starts

- Does our existing RX path surface WEP-encrypted data frames cleanly, or do some chips auto-decrypt / drop them? Should sanity-check on each working driver (`ar9271`, `rt2800usb`, `rtl8821au`, `rtl8822bu`, `rtl8812au`, `rtl8188eus`, `mt76x2u`, `mt76x0u`) — monitor-mode promiscuous RX usually delivers the encrypted bytes verbatim, but worth confirming.
- IV-dump file format: stick with `.ivs` (aircrack native, compact) or `.cap` (pcap-format, inspectable in Wireshark, ties into existing pcap export plumbing)? Lean `.cap` for symmetry with our handshake export.
- Should chopchop / fragmentation actually land before M4 ships, or after? Argument for after: ARP replay covers ≥90% of WEP-with-client cases; the fallbacks are for edge cases that may never come up in real testing.

## M5/M6 — Fragmentation (-5) + ChopChop (-4): refined design (2026-05-24)

**Status:** M1–M4 + native PTW (M7) shipped + hardware-verified. **M5
Fragmentation is now DONE + hardware-verified end-to-end** (offline crypto →
on-air probe → `en_hwseq=0` software-seq TX fix on rtl8821au → `WepFragmentation`
daemon → campaign + Focus "Frag" button → live crack of the dd-wrt box). **M6
ChopChop is the only attack left** (its crypto `chop_last_byte_and_fixup` is
done; next is its own oracle probe, then daemon, then a "Chop" toggle next to
Frag). This section supersedes the auto-escalation idea sketched in Phase 2.

Known minor: post-frag replay IV-rate (~50-80/s) trails replay off a real
client ARP (~150-200/s) — the forged ARP (default sender/target 192.168.1.x)
doesn't amplify like a real host's ARP. Fine for frag's no-client use case
(still cracks in ~2 min); optional future lever is a configurable forged-ARP
target IP.

### ARP-replay rate control: per-second burst + P&O (IMPLEMENTED 2026-05-24, PENDING HW validation)

**Deliberately simple**, after the "clever" pacing proved both jittery and
self-limiting. Each 1-second window (`_WINDOW_S`) injects `rate` packets in one
big burst at the card's full speed, then sleeps out the rest of the second — a
single ~1s sleep, immune to Windows' ~15ms timer granularity that the old
sub-cycle pacing fought (and the old small-burst + 0.15s rx-window left the
radio idle most of each cycle, capping the duty cycle). Then perturb-and-observe
on `rate` (`_maybe_adjust_rate`): if this window's IVs/s beat the last, keep the
step direction, else reverse — the rate walks toward more IVs/s and dithers at
the peak, **wherever the AP actually tops out (no low-ceiling assumption).**
`_PO_STEP_PPS=32`, start `_PO_START_PPS=100`, bounds `[20,1000]`,
`_PO_IMPROVE_EPS=5%`. P&O acts on an **EWMA** of IVs/s (`_IVS_EWMA_ALPHA=0.3`),
not the raw window: lowering the rate briefly SPIKES captured IVs/s as the AP's
queue flushes, which raw would misread as "lower = better"; the EWMA damps that
transient. 4 offline tests (keep/reverse/hold/clamp).

aircrack's `aireplay-ng -3` does NOT do any of this — it fires at a FIXED `-x`
pps (default ~500). So a dead-simple fixed-rate mode is a proven fallback if P&O
ever proves more trouble than it's worth.

**HW validation TODO:** does it climb to a real peak and hold? Crucially — does
IVs/s *scale* with rate (→ the AP wasn't the bottleneck; the old PACING was) or
plateau (→ genuinely AP-limited)? Watch heartbeat `X pps → Y IVs/s` (pps is the
smooth target now). Tunables: `_WINDOW_S` (longer=steadier/laggier), step,
deadband.

**History (don't repeat):** the adaptive burst climber hill-climbed burst size
on per-cycle gain → overshot; a fixed 150-pps cap under-drove; a fixed 400
over-drove. Optimize IVs/s (the real objective), not pps or capture% — see
[[feedback_optimize_real_metric]].

- **Earlier observations (treat as hypotheses, NOT settled):** at ~350-400 pps
  the climber got ~30 IVs/s but at ~80-120 pps got ~80 IVs/s. That *looked* like
  an interior optimum / AP rebroadcast-ceiling — but the user rightly disputes
  the AP-limited assumption: the old PACING (sub-15ms sleeps, tiny duty cycle)
  could itself be what capped throughput. The per-second-burst model is partly
  to settle this: if IVs/s now scales up with rate, the AP was never the limit.
- **The objective is IVs/s** (≈ time-to-crack), NOT pps and NOT capture% (a
  vanity metric — see [[feedback_optimize_real_metric]]).
- **Frag injection is SEPARATE + low-rate:** `WepFragmentation._inject_round`
  sends ~9 fragments then sleeps `_ROUND_GAP=0.2s` ≈ **~45 pps**, fixed cadence,
  NOT this controller. It just needs one successful round (usually round 1), so
  it's not hammering the AP and isn't part of this rework.

### State machine — human-driven, NOT auto-escalation

The earlier "replay → frag → chop ladder that auto-advances on failure" is
**dropped.** Two reasons:
- ARP Replay is never *provably* failed (may just need a client / a deauth).
- Frag/Chop failure is **ambiguous** — no AP response could be out-of-range, a
  TX glitch, *or* a genuinely immune AP, and we can't tell which. So we can
  never honestly auto-advance on "exhausted."

So transitions are **user-driven**, with exactly one auto-transition: on
**success** (which is unambiguous).

**ARP Replay is the IV engine + home base. Frag and Chop are two alternative
"manufacture an ARP seed" sub-modes** for when replay has no ARP (no client
traffic). All three are mutually-exclusive TX activities (one half-duplex
radio) — which is why `WepArpReplay` already has `pause()`/`resume()`.

```
Generate IVs ─► REPLAYING (fake-auth underneath; waits for / replays ARPs)
   │  user clicks Frag ─► pause replay ─► FRAGMENTING
   │  user clicks Chop ─► pause replay ─► CHOPPING
   │  (click the other mode = stop current + start it — click-to-switch)
   │
   FRAGMENTING/CHOPPING ──success(keystream→forged ARP)──► hand to replay,
                                                          resume ─► REPLAYING
   FRAGMENTING/CHOPPING ──round fails──► KEEP RETRYING the same mode (log
                                          progress "Frag: 0/N usable ARPs"),
                                          never auto-stop or auto-switch
   Stop IVs ─► tear everything down
```

"Keep retrying" is the point: a chosen attack loops until the *user* stops or
switches it — we never auto-stop on a failed round. Log a running tally
("Fragmentation: 0/20 rounds produced a usable ARP", "ChopChop: byte 4/36")
so the user can judge when it's fruitless and switch. The only thing the code
decides on its own is *success* (→ resume replay), because that's unambiguous;
"no response" never is (range vs TX vs immune AP), so the human calls it.

### Button UX (Focus, WEP target, campaign running)

- **Frag** and **Chop** buttons appear alongside the running campaign, each a
  Start↔Stop toggle, **always enabled** (no disable-the-other dance — clicking
  one stops the other → click-to-switch, Tab-friendly).
- The campaign owns the "only one TX activity at a time" invariant via
  `replay.pause()`/`resume()`.

### Both attacks reduce to: keystream → forge ARP → feed replay

- **Fragmentation [Bittau 2005]:** XOR a captured frame against the known
  LLC/SNAP prefix → 8 bytes of keystream. Send ≤16 tiny fragments (each
  encrypted with that keystream) of a known-plaintext frame; the AP reassembles
  + re-encrypts under one fresh IV + relays it → capture that → recover a
  *longer* keystream (~1500 B). Enough keystream → forge a broadcast ARP.
- **ChopChop [KoreK 2004]:** chop the last byte of a captured frame, guess its
  plaintext (256 tries), fix the ICV (CRC32 is linear), send; the AP relays it
  iff the guess was right (the oracle). Walk backwards → full plaintext +
  keystream, no key. → forge a broadcast ARP.

### Build order (de-risk like we did the cracker)

1. ~~**`wep_crypto.py` FIRST — offline, fully unit-testable, no hardware.**~~
   ✅ **DONE + verified** (commits 06bc85b, 798126c, 5503b09):
   `icv`, `wep_encrypt`, `forge_arp_request`, AND `chop_last_byte_and_fixup`
   (the ChopChop linear-ICV fix-up — landed via affine-CRC cancellation +
   a GF(2) trailing-byte solve, gated by a decrypt→check-residue oracle).
   11 offline tests in `tests/engine/test_wep_crypto.py`. So the ENTIRE crypto
   surface of frag + chopchop is built and proven with zero hardware.
2. **Fragmentation send-side primitives — ✅ DONE + offline-verified** (`build_fragments`,
   `seed_keystream_from_arp`, `arp_request_plaintext` in `wep_crypto.py`; 5 new
   tests). KEY SIMPLIFICATION: the frag payload is itself a **broadcast ARP**, so
   one round collapses three things — the AP's relay is simultaneously (a) the
   oracle's success signal, (b) a directly replayable ARP seed, and (c) ~40 B of
   fresh keystream (XOR vs our known 36-B plaintext). Seed PRGA is free from a
   captured broadcast ARP (fixed SNAP+ethertype `AA AA 03 00 00 00 08 06`). 8-B
   seed → 4 data bytes/fragment → 16×4=64 ≥ the 36-B ARP. The send-side tests
   prove SELF-CONSISTENCY (a simulated reassembly round-trips) — NOT that the
   real AP reassembles+relays; only the probe can establish that.
3. **`scripts/wep/frag_probe.py` — ✅ READY for hardware** (the README's
   recommended first hardware step): fake-auths, sends fragmented broadcast-ARP
   rounds, dumps EVERY RX frame timestamped to a `.pcap` + console log, flags
   candidate relays (fresh-IV FromDS broadcast WEP data from our forged SA). The
   pcap is the ground truth (spec+pcap model). **NEXT: run at the dd-wrt box,
   read the pcap, then code `fragmentation.py`'s oracle to what's observed.**
4. **Fragmentation VERIFIED END-TO-END ON HARDWARE (2026-05-24).** The
   `en_hwseq=0` software-sequence fix (rtl8821au `build_tx_desc_data`) let the
   dd-wrt box reassemble our 9 fragments and rebroadcast the result; decrypting
   a relay with the test key confirmed it byte-for-byte as our forged ARP. **The
   live-AP ORACLE SIGNATURE (the thing `fragmentation.py` watches RX for):**
   a Data frame, **FromDS** + **Protected**, **Addr1 (DA) = broadcast**,
   **Addr3 (SA) = our forged STA MAC**, **fresh IV** (≠ our seed IV), ~68 B
   (24 hdr + 4 IV/KeyID + 36 ARP + 4 ICV). It appears post-burst on the target
   BSSID *and its sibling BSSes* (the box rebroadcasts our broadcast onto each
   BSS), so match on `Addr3 == our_mac`, not on a specific `Addr2`/BSSID. That
   relayed frame is also already an ARP-sized broadcast → the capture store logs
   it as a replay seed automatically. So fragmentation **success = "a relay with
   our SA appeared"** → tell the campaign, which resumes ARP replay (the new
   seed is in the store). Tooling: `scripts/wep/frag_probe.py` (inject + dump) +
   `scripts/wep/analyze_frag_pcap.py` (`--key` decrypt-verify).
5. **`fragmentation.py` DONE + wired** (`WepFragmentation`): seeds from any WEP
   data frame (LLC/SNAP known-plaintext, ethertype 0x0800 then 0x0806 — NOT a
   replayable ARP), fragments a broadcast ARP under a shared sw_seq, watches the
   pinned oracle, hands the relay to the campaign on success (immediate handoff),
   keeps retrying on a barren round. Campaign owns the Frag sub-mode
   (`start_frag`/`stop_frag`/`_on_frag_success`, replay pause/resume); Focus has
   the "Frag" toggle.
6. **ChopChop oracle VERIFIED ON HARDWARE (2026-05-24)** via
   `scripts/wep/chopchop_probe.py` (sweeps all 256 guesses for one byte, NO
   sw_seq — single frames, dumps RX). On the dd-wrt box: sweeping a 68-B frame,
   ONLY the true-last-byte guess (`0xc9`, known via `--key abcde`) elicited a
   relay — proof the AP checks the ICV and relays just the valid guess (an
   invalid-ICV-relaying AP would have echoed all 256). **VERIFIED ORACLE
   SIGNATURE for chopchop.py:** Data + FromDS + Protected + Addr1(DA)=broadcast
   + **Addr3(SA)=our STA** + **len == orig−1** (one byte shorter). Match on SA,
   NOT BSSID — one correct guess produced **2 relays** (same frame echoed onto
   sibling BSSes, fresh IV each), so **de-dup**. **Per-guess relay latency ≈
   3 ms** → daemon oracle timeout ~20 ms (margin for jitter); send each guess
   2-3× / retry a byte if all 256 miss (single `use_no_ack` sends can be lost).
7. **`chopchop.py` daemon + "Chop" toggle — ✅ DONE + wired (PENDING HW)**
   (`WepChopChop`): picks a captured broadcast ARP, chops the variable tail
   (positions 16..39; ks[0..15] from the known SNAP+ARP-request prefix) via the
   pinned oracle, recovering ks[i]=body[i]^accepted-guess per step → forges a
   broadcast ARP from the keystream → on_forged_arp. NO sw_seq (single frames);
   per-guess oracle timeout 20ms; re-sweeps a byte once on a clean miss; keeps
   retrying / blacklists a stalled seed (never auto-stops). Campaign owns
   `start_chop`/`stop_chop`/`_on_chop_success` (records the forged ARP as a
   replay seed since it's not AP-relayed like frag, then resumes replay);
   mutually exclusive with frag (click-to-switch). Focus has the "Chop" toggle
   next to "Frag". 5 offline tests drive the byte-walk against a simulated
   decrypt-and-check-ICV oracle (recovers the true keystream; forges a valid
   ARP; oracle matcher). **PENDING HW: run Generate IVs → Chop on the box;
   expect byte-progress logs then "ChopChop recovered keystream → seeded
   replay". Slower than frag (~256 guesses/byte).**

### File status

`wep_crypto.py` + `fragmentation.py` + `chopchop.py` are all implemented + tested
+ wired (campaign + Focus toggles). Hardware status (2026-05-31, see the known
issue below):
- **ARP replay** — works on every card tried.
- **ChopChop** — daemon now confirmed end-to-end on RTL8812AU, RTL8822BU, and
  AR9271 (the earlier "PENDING a live run" note is resolved — M6 done).
- **Fragmentation** — **removed** (see "Fragmentation — removed" below);
  `fragmentation.py` kept as a dormant reference.

## Fragmentation — removed (2026-06-02)

Fragmentation (`-5`) was the one WEP attack that needed every fragment of an
MSDU to keep **one shared 802.11 sequence number** (`build_fragments` stamps it
with incrementing fragment numbers + the More-Fragments bit). That required
injecting with `en_hwseq=0` so the chip doesn't auto-assign the sequence — a
**software-sequence TX path that was only ever wired on the RTL8821AU**
(`SUPPORTS_SW_SEQ` + `tx.build_tx_desc_data`). On every other card the hint was
dropped, each fragment got a different hardware-incremented sequence, the AP
never reassembled, and the daemon span on "seed wouldn't relay."

One card arbitrarily owning one attack was a maintenance smell, and WEP barely
surfaces in 2026 — **ARP-replay + ChopChop carry the suite**. So the sw-seq
plumbing was removed: `SUPPORTS_SW_SEQ`, `en_hwseq=0`, `build_tx_desc_data`,
`interface.send_raw(sw_seq=)`, and `supports_sw_seq` are gone, and the Frag
button / campaign sub-mode were unhooked. `fragmentation.py` is kept as a
**dormant reference implementation** — it won't run as-is (its send loop calls
the removed `send_raw(sw_seq=)`).

Re-introducing it should NOT recreate a per-driver special case. The honest path
is *shared* sequence-ID support in the TX framework (e.g. `rtw88_base`) first —
deferred; tracked in `docs/porting/METHODOLOGY.md`.
