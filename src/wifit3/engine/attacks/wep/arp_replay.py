"""WEP ARP replay (`aireplay-ng -3`) — the IV workhorse.

Re-injects a captured WEP-encrypted ARP request on a loop. The AP can't tell
it's a replay (WEP has no replay protection — that absence is *why* this
works), so it decrypts and rebroadcasts each one under a FRESH IV. Every
rebroadcast is a new unique IV for the cracker. This is the only attack in
the suite that actually generates IVs; fake-auth gates it and (later)
frag/chopchop only manufacture an ARP to feed it.

Only ToDS (client→AP) ARPs are usable seeds — the collector enforces that.

Candidate handling (deliberately PATIENT): the AP's rebroadcast of a good ARP
can arrive a beat after a single short burst, so judging a candidate on one
cycle falsely condemns replayable seeds. Instead each candidate gets a multi-
second trial; only a sustained absence of echoes blacklists it. "Replayable"
means the AP echoed OUR frame back — we match its rebroadcast on FromDS +
broadcast DA + SA==our MAC, the same correlation frag/chopchop use — NOT that
the global IV count happened to rise (another client's traffic must never be
mistaken for a working replay). Once the AP echoes one, we lock on and keep
replaying it. If a locked winner stalls (likely we got de-associated) we ask
fake-auth to re-auth and keep the same seed rather than discarding it.

Operating shape (deliberately SIMPLE): fixed 1-second windows. Each window we
blast ``rate`` packets at the card's full speed, then sleep out the rest of the
second (one ~1s sleep — immune to Windows' ~15ms timer granularity, unlike
per-frame pacing) while the AP's rebroadcasts land. Count IVs gained that
second, then a perturb-and-observe step nudges ``rate`` toward more IVs/s. No
per-cycle pacing math, no idle-heavy small bursts capping the duty cycle.
