# RTL8822BU — vendor/DKMS port (playbook)

> ## NEXT AGENT — START HERE
>
> **Goal: a 100% byte-for-byte port of the morrownr vendor stack, measured by the Pcap Replay.
> Byte-for-byte over beacons** — a fully reproduced port that yields 0 beacons is the win; a <100%
> port that "works" is not. Don't chase RX symptoms; reproduce the wire.
>
> **TOP BUG — SOLVED 2026-06-16: 2.4 GHz RX was on the WRONG ANTENNA.** Root cause: the wifi-only
> coex band-notify (`hal8822b_wifi_only_switch_antenna`, `halbtc8822bwifionly.c:69`) sets the RX
> **antenna mux** `0xCBC[9:8]` per band (2.4 GHz = 2, 5 GHz = 1). It was **un-ported** — mis-deferred as
> "BT-coex no-op" — so cold init left `0xCBC[9:8] = 0` (neither band's path) and 2.4 GHz RX ran on the
> wrong antenna: a flat ~15–20 dB deficit hitting **both** CCK-1M and low-rate OFDM beacons (5 GHz fine,
> since its path is the cold-init default; CCK-demod/CCK-PD/IGI/IQK all ruled out). The symptom was
> "data flies, beacons die" — only strong local stations punched through. **Fix:** `chan._wifi_only_
> switch_antenna` writes `0xCBC[9:8]=2/1`, called from `set_channel_bw` on a band change (after the
> channel set, matching the wire). **Confirmed:** HW `--set 0xCBC=0x200` lifted NETGEAR2G (30:85:..d2:18)
> from ~0% → 59%, RSSI recovered +20–40 dB (now −53, matching the vendor's −48), APs heard 9 → 23.
> Gate: `verify_initial_tune` 167 ops byte-for-byte, `verify_channels` 35/35 (ch1 crossing now lands on
> TXAGC), `verify_pcap` unchanged. **Secondary (open, minor):** with the right antenna the strongest APs
> now arrive ~−41 dBm and saturate at the frozen `dig_init` IGI — the **DIG watchdog** must run to back
> gain off; tune/verify the watchdog for the now-loud environment to land NETGEAR2G at the 8–10 bcn/s target.
> The diagnostics: `cck_diag.py` (live, rate-split, capture% vs beacon-interval) + `cck_capref.py` (the
> vendor's own bulk-IN from the capture's FIXED-CH1 window).
>
> **SESSION 2026-06-16 — port functionally complete + Pcap-Replay-audited (for post-port work):**
> - Antenna-mux fix **committed** (`chan._wifi_only_switch_antenna`), not just `--set`-tested.
> - **TX descriptor fixed**: G_ID was hardcoded 63 (broke *unicast*/targeted-deauth — 0/128 match); now
>   BMC-keyed (63 bcast / 0 unicast) = **251/251 byte-for-byte** vs the captured aireplay injector. The
>   old "byte-for-byte, only seqctl varies" claim was never actually byte-checked — it was wrong.
> - **Deauth + 4-way handshake confirmed LIVE** (user run): client dropped+reconnected, M1-M4 captured,
>   crackable M2 (ToDS) reachable. TX *and* concurrent RX both work.
> - **Severe `verify_pcap` audit COMPLETE → see the Pcap Replay Gap Ledger below.** Every potential
>   divergence G1–G19 resolved 🟢; the antenna mux was the SOLE real RX bug. New gates close verify_pcap's
>   three blind spots (early-stop, matched-prologue, replayed-reads): `verify_initial_tune.py`,
>   `verify_strict_audit.py` (0 wrong-writes across all 35 hops), `verify_abg_hop.py`, `poll_probe.py`
>   (HW-verified dc_cancellation/poll-loops converge live), `verify_full_audit.py`, `driver_rx_probe.py`.
> - **OPEN (none block the port):** (1) **matched-load RX capture%** — confirm NETGEAR2G hits ~vendor 84% on a
>   QUIET ch1 (the user's work box was flooding ch1 at ~10× the capture's load; test with it off — this is
>   the last "is the ~6/s vs ~8/s gap pure airtime?" check); (2) **thermal tx-power tracking** un-ported
>   (`phydm_rf_watchdog`; minor, sustained-flood-only — the one TX gap); (3) a **transient cold-state RX
>   wedge** seen once (0 frames; replug/rerun clears — the known 8822bu pattern, not a code defect).
>   (4) **Intermittent cold-boot 2.4 GHz synth wedge — SOLVED 2026-06-16.** ~20% of cold boots left the
>   2.4 GHz synth **unlocked** (RF18 **bit15** set after the initial tune) → every 2.4 GHz hop caught 0
>   frames until a 5→2.4 band re-cycle; 5 GHz always fine. **Not a port miss** — the bring-up wire is
>   byte-for-byte (verify_pcap / verify_channels green) and the vendor reproduces the same ops; it's a
>   HW synth-lock fault the kernel's tight transfer pacing avoids and userland USB intermittently hits.
>   Proven on HW: the cold→2.4 tune writes RF18 bit16=0 but the chip forces it back (synth pinned at
>   5 GHz); no RF18 write un-sticks it. **Recovery = the chip's own 5→2.4 re-cycle, but only after the
>   synth has SETTLED** — an immediate bounce does nothing (HW-measured: heal fired 3× back-to-back,
>   still deaf), a bounce after a short settle re-locks every time. **Fix:** `driver._heal_cold_synth`
>   (runs after `enable_monitor`): if RF18 bit15 is set, `sleep(0.3)` + re-cycle 5→2.4, re-check, ≤4×.
>   No-op on the ~80% of clean boots. **Validated: 80/80 cold-boot soak 2.4 GHz-OK (was ~20% deaf);
>   `scripts/rtl8822bu_dkms/soak_2g.py` is the automated repro (each connect() is a cold cycle — no

## 2.4 GHz RX deafness — SOLVED (wrong antenna mux)

**Root cause (2026-06-16): the 2.4 GHz RX antenna mux `0xCBC[9:8]` was never set.** The wifi-only coex
band-notify (`hal8822b_wifi_only_switch_antenna`, `halbtc8822bwifionly.c:69`) selects the RX antenna path
per band — 2.4 GHz = 2, 5 GHz = 1 — and fires on every scan/band/connect notify. It was un-ported
(mis-deferred as "BT-coex no-op"; even this doc's old "Coverage gaps" note waved off the `0xCBC` write on
crossings as BT-coex). Cold init leaves `0xCBC[9:8] = 0` (neither band), so 2.4 GHz RX ran on the wrong
antenna — a flat ~15–20 dB deficit on **every** 2.4 GHz signal. 5 GHz was unaffected (its path is the
default). **Fix:** `chan._wifi_only_switch_antenna` (called from `set_channel_bw` on a band change, after
the channel set). Gate-verified byte-for-byte (`verify_initial_tune` 167 ops → TXAGC; `verify_channels`
35/35). HW: forcing `0xCBC[9:8]=2` lifted NETGEAR2G 0% → 59%, RSSI +20–40 dB (−53, ≈ the vendor's −48), APs
heard 9 → 23. The diagnostic methodology that found it is below; it earlier mis-pointed at IGI/gain (a
confound — see the footnote).

The symptom was "data flies (1400/s), beacons die (0–1/s)": only strong local stations punched through the
bad antenna path. The earlier "CCK demod broken / OFDM fine" framing was wrong on two counts — the strong
`38:d5` APs actually beacon at **CCK-1M** (HW `rx_rate`), and low-rate **OFDM** beacons were hit just as
hard (the tell it was a band-wide RX-path problem, not CCK demod).

**Ground truth — vendor vs us, same APs / same environment, ch1** (`cck_capref.py` reads the capture's
15 s FIXED-CH1 bulk-IN; `cck_diag.py` measures live; capture% = beacons caught ÷ the AP's advertised
100-TU interval, so it is independent of our RSSI decode):

| AP (beacon rate) | vendor capt% | our capt% (live) |
|---|---|---|
| 38:d5:..eb (CCK-1M) | **89%** | ~18–55% |
| 30:85:..d2:18 (CCK-1M) | **84%** | ~13–32% |
| 38:d5:..e8 (CCK-1M) | **79%** | ~40–60% |
| 1e:9e:..e4:7e (**OFDM**-6M) | **79%** | **3%** |
| 1e:9e:..e4:7a (**OFDM**-6M) | **73%** | **1%** |

The OFDM-beacon rows are the tell: the deficit is **not CCK-specific**, so it is not a CCK-demod/filter
bug. The vendor hits 9–10 bcn/s every second of the 15 s window; we average ~5.

**Ruled out (HW-measured):** CRC/demod corruption (0 crc_err / 0 icv_err across *every* rate, every run —
when a frame is detected it decodes perfectly); the **CCK-PD threshold** `0xA0A` (`--cckpd 0x40` sensitive
LV_0 → no change on busy ch1 *or* quiet ch3); airtime contention (quiet ch3, ~0 OFDM/s, still ~55% on the
strongest CCK AP). The runtime watchdog drives IGI the *right* way (→`0x1c` + CCK-PD→`0x40`); the old
"watchdog makes CCK worse" claim did not reproduce.

**IGI was a red herring (footnote).** Forcing IGI `0x20→0x10` *seemed* to lift d2:18 to 74% in one run,
but a within-run `--igisweep` on a strong AP was flat across `0x10..0x38` — the "improvement" was the
run-to-run instability of the wrong-antenna path (RSSI swung ±25 dB, RF18 occasionally read a stray
`0x18c01`), not a gain effect. With the antenna fixed, RX is sensitive again; the remaining gain work is
the opposite — the **DIG watchdog** must run to tame now-strong APs (≈−41 dBm) that saturate at the
frozen `dig_init` IGI. That is the secondary, open item for hitting the 8–10 bcn/s target on NETGEAR2G.

**Repro / diagnostics:** `uv run python scripts/rtl8822bu_dkms/cck_diag.py --channel 1 --dwell 20`
(rate-split, per-AP capture% vs beacon-interval; flags `--watchdog`, `--igisweep`, `--bssid`, `--set`,
`--cckpd`, `--scan`); `cck_capref.py` for the vendor's own bulk-IN from the FIXED-CH1 window;
`verify_initial_tune.py` gates the initial 2.4 GHz channel-set + antenna notify byte-for-byte.

## Pcap Replay Gap Ledger (severe audit, opened 2026-06-16)

Running list of every place our port may diverge from the vendor wire, found by source diff against
`driver-source/` (the antenna mux taught us "deferred/dead-code" labels lie — every entry gets a
source-proven verdict, never an assumption). **Per-gap A/B protocol** (run once gap-finding is complete):
(A) baseline beacon capture before any change; (2) make the port reproduce the vendor wire for that gap; (3) re-measure (B);
(4) **regression → revert + flag** (a miss can be an improvement only once combined with other misses);
**no-change/improvement → commit + document** (byte-for-byte reproduction is the goal regardless of beacon delta).

Status key: 🔴 confirmed gap (port it) · 🟡 pending source verdict · 🟢 proven legit (cite) · ⚪ A/B done.

**AUDIT OUTCOME (2026-06-16): all gaps G1–G19 resolved 🟢 — the antenna mux (`0xCBC[9:8]`, fixed +
committed) was the SOLE real RX bug.** Every other potential divergence is proven no-op / inert-unlinked
/ telemetry / TX-side / superseded-by-enable_monitor / HW-verified-converges for monitor RX, so **no
further port changes were needed** (the A/B sweep produced documentation, not code). G1/G11/G13 (the
watchdog "real gaps") turned out to be no-ops in monitor: their register values already match the
vendor's monitor values, `rssi_min` stays low unlinked, and DIG-damping is `!is_linked`-gated. The port
reproduces the vendor wire for monitor RX; remaining beacon-rate headroom vs baseline is airtime, not a port gap.

| # | Gap | Vendor [SRC] | Our state | RX? | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | `0x98c` RX MRC antenna-weighting | `phydm_dynamic_ant_weighting_8822b` — every watchdog; 2.4G `rssi_min≤37`→`0x98c=0x43440000` | cold-init table already sets `0x98c=0x43440000` | **no-op**: capture writes `0x43440000` 35×/monitor (rssi_min stays ≤37 unlinked) = our default; value never changes | 🟢 |
| G2 | opmode block op 9855 | `hw_var_set_opmode`: MSR/net-type, BCN_CTRL `0x550`, RX-filter `0x6a2`, LED | `enable_monitor` instead; MAC-addr ported | OS interface-up — RX parts superseded by `enable_monitor` (RCR/RXFLTMAP/MSR-no-link); MAC-addr ported; strict-audit found no wrong-writes | 🟢 |
| G3 | airodump `--band abg` native hop | scan-tune == `config_phydm_switch_channel`; window interleaves 2 s watchdog ticks | we hop via the same `set_channel` | `verify_abg_hop.py`: scan-tune == set_channel (ch1 replays 131 ops byte-for-byte); rest of the window is watchdog ticks (`0x98c/0x994/0xfa4`/FA-counters) — both verified components; no hidden op | 🟢 |
| G4 | recurring post-TXAGC tail `0xfa4/0xfb4/0x280/0x283/0x840/0x8d8` | **NOT DPK** — 8822b has no DPK (no `dpk_track_8822b` case; `HAL_RF_DPK_TRACK` unset). It is the 2 s PHYDM watchdog firing in the window (TXPAUSE + env-monitor + CFO/FA-counter reads) | watchdog ported | watchdog activity, already characterized — not a per-channel cal | 🟢 |
| G19 | `0x0608` (RCR) in DARK census | only 2 writes post-monitor (f20411/20421), both `0x90000001` = the enable_monitor RCR | `enable_monitor` sets RCR=0x90000001 | enable-monitor bleed, not per-hop; we reproduce it | 🟢 |
| G5 | env-monitor watchdog `0x994` | `phydm_env_mntr_{result,set}_watchdog` (NHM/CLM/FAHM) | not run in our 2s loop | **telemetry** — DIG `fa_source=0` (dig.c:1023) so DIG uses `cnt_all`, not FAHM | 🟢 |
| G6 | `phydm_noisy_detection` | 11AC, every watchdog | not run | **telemetry** — `noisy_decision` absent from `phydm_dig.c` (no DIG coupling) | 🟢 |
| G13 | DIG damping `phydm_dig_damping_chk` | `CFG_DIG_DAMPING_CHK` on (8822b) | our `phydm_dig` omits it | **inert unlinked**: both `phydm_dig_damping_chk` (dig.c:111) + `phydm_dig_recorder` (dig.c:55) return on `!is_linked` | 🟢 |
| G7 | `odm_dtc` (CE) | body wrapped in `CONFIG_DM_RESP_TXAGC`; RSSI-based **TX-power** decade | not run | TX-side + needs link → inert in monitor | 🟢 |
| G8 | `halrf_watchdog` | `phydm_rf_watchdog` (thermal TX-pwr track) + `halrf_dpk_track` (DPK) | not run | TX/thermal/DPK cal — RX-irrelevant in monitor | 🟢 |
| G9 | `phydm_update_power_training_state` | returns on `!is_linked` (pow_train.c:54) | not run | inert unlinked | 🟢 |
| G10 | `phydm_dyn_bw_indication` | `phydm_bw_fixed_setting` (`0x840` BW20); auto-bw branch needs `is_linked` | we already write `0x840` BW20 in `_switch_bandwidth_20` | no-op: watchdog re-applies the same 20 MHz value; auto-bw inert unlinked | 🟢 |
| G11 | `phydm_dynamic_switch_htstf_mumimo_8822b` | uncond.; rssi_min<35 → `0x8d8[17]=0` | runtime `0x8d8[17]=0` already (cold-init + switch_band) | **no-op**: capture's monitor `0x8d8` has bit 17=0; htstf writes 0 = our value | 🟢 |
| G12 | `dc_cancellation` live-poll integrity | `phydm_stop_ic_trx` polls `0xFA0` for BB-idle | ported | **HW-verified** (`poll_probe.py`): idle reached both paths (1 read each); DC comp applied `0xC10=0x100`/`0xC14=0x3d00dc00`/… from live `0xFA0` — runs fully | 🟢 |
| G14 | opmode LED `0x4a`/`0x4e` | `pinmux_wl_led` (async `LedControlUSB`) | not ported | cosmetic pinmux — no RX | 🟢 |
| G15 | opmode BCN_CTRL `0x550` / RX-filter `0x6a2` | managed-vif beacon-params + mgmt filter | `enable_monitor` sets RCR=0x90000001 + RXFLTMAP0/1/2=0xFFFF (gate-verified 20 ops) | RXFLTMAP=0xFFFF supersedes the managed `0x6a2`; BCN_CTRL monitor-inert | 🟢 |
| G16 | `get_dbg_port_info` (adaptivity) | `phydm_adaptivity` ADAPT-mode dbg-port `0x209` | not run | adaptivity_init seeds NORMAL (not ADAPT) mode → ADAPT dbg-port dormant; our adaptivity ports the NORMAL branch | 🟢 |
| G17 | crystal-cap + EFUSE decode | xtal_cap (efuse `0x2F`)→`0x24/0x28`; PG map | ported (read-dependent) | validated transitively — all EFUSE-derived cold-init writes are byte-for-byte in verify_pcap (a misread would diverge) | 🟢 |
| G18 | cold-path poll-loops live integrity | FW-ready `0xC078`, mac_pwr `0x05`, `config_trx_mode` RF33, tx_current_cal | ported | **HW-verified**: `cold_bringup` runs to completion live (`poll_probe.py`/`test_hw --phase init`) → every poll converges (would hang otherwise) | 🟢 |

**Strict per-phase audit result (`verify_strict_audit.py`, cap-1):** initial-tune + all 35 hops replay
**byte-for-byte with ZERO wrong-writes** — no second antenna-mux-class bug in any hop tail (the
matched-prologue blind spot is closed). The DARK tails decode entirely to the 2 s watchdog cycle
(incl. G1 `0x98c`; G4 — there is no DPK on 8822b) + opmode/band bleed from the coarse iw.log windows +
TXAGC-skipped-on-crossings — no novel RX register beyond the cataloged gaps (and the `0x608` curiosity, G19).

## TX-path audit (2026-06-16) — for the injection/deauth path

wifit3's TX is frame injection (the agent never live-fires; correctness is source + pcap-verified,
benefit measured by the human). Audited against the captured aireplay injector (251 TX frames, f74236+):

| Item | State | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| TX descriptor `build_inject_txdesc` | **FIXED** (G_ID was hardcoded 63) | **byte-for-byte 251/251** vs the capture (33 bcast + 218 unicast, each fed its own rate) after the G_ID=BMC-keyed fix |
| TXAGC TX-power `set_tx_power_level` | ported | byte-for-byte — `verify_channels` 35/35; by-rate/limit fold to base (`CONFIG_TXPWR_*_EN=n`) |
| TxA-bias current cal `tx_current_calibration` | ported (cold init) | byte-verified in `verify_pcap` |
| IQK | not run | `mp_mode`-gated — vendor doesn't run it in normal mode either (RX-audit finding) |
| DPK | n/a | does not exist on 8822b (no `dpk_track_8822b`) |
| Thermal TX-power tracking `phydm_rf_watchdog`→`odm_txpowertracking_check_ce` | un-ported | TX-side; gated on `HAL_RF_TX_PWR_TRACK` + thermal-delta. Negligible for burst injection (TXAGC base is byte-for-byte), at most a few-dB drift on a sustained flood — the one open (minor) TX gap |
| watchdog `cfo_tracking` / `ra_info` / `dynamic_tx_power` | un-ported | link/assoc-gated — inert for injection (no association) |

**Headline: the G_ID hardcode was a real injector bug** — it broke unicast (targeted-deauth) descriptors
(0/128 match); now byte-for-byte. The rest of the TX path is byte-for-byte or negligibly-gapped; the only
standing TX item is thermal power-tracking, which matters only for sustained injection.

Proven-legit (no action): `adaptive_soml` (`!is_linked` early-return), `receiver_blocking`/`primary_cca`/
`hwigi`/`lna_sat_chk`/`beamforming_watchdog(V1)`/`mu_rsoml` (compiled-out for 8822b — `phydm_features_ce.h`).
TX/assoc watchdog members expected-inert unlinked, verdict pending: `ra_info`, `cfo_tracking`,
`tx_path_diversity`, `dynamic_tx_power`.

## Pcap Replay Accuracy scoreboard — what "byte-for-byte per the Pcap Replay" actually covers

**Do not call this port "byte-for-byte per the Pcap Replay" without this qualifier.** It means exactly one thing:
`verify_pcap` reproduces the **cold init** (op 0–9855, ~33% of the 29 542 captured control ops)
byte-for-byte. That is the only span with a standing 100% gate. The runtime wire (op 9855 → ~28910,
where aireplay TX begins) is partial or unported:

| Span | State |
|---|---|
| Cold init, op 0–9855 | ✅ byte-for-byte (`verify_pcap`) |
| `set_channel` hop **prologue** | ✅ byte-for-byte (`verify_channels`, 132–776 ops/hop) |
| `enable_monitor` (20 ops) | ✅ slice-verified (`verify_pcap`) |
| initial channel-set / `switch_band` | ✅ 165 ops, offline replay — **no standing gate** |
| opmode block (op 9855) — MAC-addr | ✅ ported (`set_mac_addr`, EFUSE, replay-verified) |
| opmode block — LED (`0x4a`/`0x4e`) | ⏭️ SKIPPED by lead decision — cosmetic async pinmux indicator (`LedControlUSB` timer; `0x62→0x28` not byte-reproducible) |
| opmode block — BCN_CTRL / RXFLTMAP1 | ⚠️ managed-vif defaults `enable_monitor` overrides (RXFLTMAP1→0xFFFF) — monitor-inert, not ported |
| **`phydm_watchdog`** (RX members) — `fa_cnt`→`reg_reset`→`cck_pd`→`dig`→`adaptivity` | ✅ ported + wired (2 s loop in connect()): `fa_cnt` replay-verified 20/20; DIG/cck_pd/adaptivity 15 unit tests. Un-freezes IGI (0xC50/0xE50), CCK-PD (0xA0A), EDCCA (0x8A4) |
| `phydm_watchdog` — get_dbg_port_info | ⚠️ ADAPT-mode/diagnostic only — dormant in the CE NORMAL default (adaptivity_dbg_port 0x209 set-but-unused on 8822b) |
| `phydm_watchdog` — tx_power_tracking, cfo_tracking, ra_info | ⚠️ monitor dead-code (TX / association-specific; never run unlinked) — not ported, documented |
| TX descriptor (`build_inject_txdesc`, inject_frame) | ✅ ported — `update_txdesc` MGNT branch, **byte-matches the captured aireplay injector** (251 deauth TX frames, only HW seqctl varies); 8 unit tests |
| TX descriptor | ⛔ unported |

RX works, but the continuous runtime adaptation the capture runs (DIG/FA/spur) is not reproduced: the
golden capture holds **24 bcn/s median, 90+/s peak** while hopping; our RX measures lower. The honest
one-line status is **"cold init byte-for-byte; runtime partial,"** never "100% byte-for-byte."

**Opmode-block scope finding.** The opmode block (f19967–19999) is *not* HALMAC chip init — it is the
kernel net/mlme/cfg80211 + LED layer bringing up a default **managed** vif, which airmon then overrides
with monitor. Evidence: `0x4a`/`0x4e` are the HALMAC GPIO-pinmux **WL_LED** indicator
(`pinmux_wl_led_sw_ctrl` = `0x4e` BIT3; the full init pulls in the pinmux mode engine), driven by the
**async** `LedControlUSB` handler; `0x550=0x1c` is a 1-byte BCN_CTRL RMW (not the flat `InitBeaconParameters`
write16); `0x6a2=0x0001` is a managed mgmt filter that `enable_monitor` overwrites with `0xFFFF` ~400
frames later in the same capture. The only chip-state piece functional for wifit3 (a monitor/injection
tool that implements its *own* net layer) is the **MAC-addr — ported**. Open question for the lead:
byte-replay the kernel's managed-vif interface-up (port the mlme RMWs + the pinmux LED engine for a
cosmetic light), or treat it as out-of-scope like aireplay's TX? Until decided, it is flagged, not
silently skipped.

## Post-Port Checklist (planning/PORTING.md) — steps 1–6

1. **Waivers** — cold init (→op 9855) + airmon monitor entry reproduce single-cursor with zero
   waived ops; the only frontier is the OS opmode block (op 9855), outside the chip-init gate. ✅
2. **Skip audit** — documented, evidence-backed skips: LED (cosmetic async pinmux), BCN_CTRL/RXFLTMAP1
   (managed-vif, `enable_monitor`-overridden), watchdog `tx_power_tracking`/`cfo`/`ra` (TX/assoc
   dead-code in monitor), `get_dbg_port_info` (ADAPT-mode dormant). ✅
3. **Capture coverage** — cap-1 (cold boot) passes full single-cursor; cap-2/3 diverge at op 9468 on a
   **warm-reload stale `central_ch` software static** (not on the wire, not HW-readable) — our cold-boot
   `central_ch=0` is the correct cold-boot model, not a bug. ✅
4. **TX byte-diff** — `build_inject_txdesc` byte-matches the capture's 251 aireplay deauth TX descriptors
   (`update_txdesc` MGNT branch; MACID=1/G_ID=63/RTY_LMT/SW_DEFINE all source-pinned). ✅
5. **Async producers** — the always-on PHYDM DIG watchdog is *dispatched* (2 s loop, `connect()`), not
   stripped; `cfo`/`ra`/`tx_pwr` correctly don't run in monitor. ✅
6. **Recal cadence** — per-channel recal in `set_channel_bw` (band/channel/bandwidth/TXAGC); periodic
   DIG recal dispatched; the per-hop `_io_lock` prevents a cancelled tune leaving a stale channel. ✅
7. **Hands-on break-it pass** — the human's step (replug/soak/live-TX); `deauth_hw.py` is the TX tool.

## RX = 0 frames — RESOLVED (live monitor RX works)

**Root cause:** `set_channel_bw` ran `switch_band` only on a 2.4↔5 crossing, so the first tune
(`prev_ch=None`) skipped it. Cold init leaves the synth in 5 GHz, so the first 2.4 GHz tune *is* a
band change — and `switch_band` wires the 2.4 GHz RX path to the antenna (CCK enable `0x808[28]`,
iFEM RFE switch `0xCB0/0xCA0`, `0x8CC/0x8D8`). Without it the antenna stays unswitched → BB hears
only the noise floor → every frame fails FCS. Fix (`8c2e907`): run `switch_band` whenever
`(prev_ch is None or prev_ch>14)` differs from `ch>14`. HW: ch6 → 7 APs/383 bcn; hop 1-13 → 25 APs/
447 bcn.

The byte-for-byte gate stayed green because the *initial* channel-set is a capture window neither
`verify_pcap` (stops at op 9855) nor `verify_channels` (iw.log hops, all `prev_ch` set) slices — a
gate-green-but-not-sufficient seam (PORTING.md Step 6). If RX regresses, `test_hw --rxstats CH [--rcr 0x90000301]` tallies
`rx_pkt_desc` categories + RSSI + `RF_0x18` without the good-frame filter.

## Verified facts (ground truth)

- **USB** `[WIRE]`: `2357:0138` (Archer T3U Plus), single config; control ep0, **bulk-OUT 0x05**
  (FW/TX), **bulk-IN 0x84** (RX). Register IO = Realtek `bRequest=0x05` vendor control xfer (READ
  0xC0/WRITE 0x40, addr in wValue) `[SRC] include/usb_ops.h:19`. **0x4E0 page-switch mirror**: every
  ON-section access (`addr ≤ 0xFF` or `0x1000-0x10FF`) is followed by a 1-byte W to `0x4E0` carrying
  the IO low byte `[SRC] os_dep/linux/usb_ops_linux.c:171`; reproduced in `transport.py`.
- **Re-runnability** = clean reset every boot (not warm-skip). `mac_pwr_switch_usb_8822b` detects
  already-on (returns UNCHANGE); `rtw_halmac_poweron` then forces card_dis_flow OFF→ON
  `[SRC] hal_halmac.c:2744`. Ported in `mac.power_on`; the OFF→ON cycle has no cold capture (proven by
  HW double-run). *Open: whether it recovers on Windows+WinUSB.*

## Cold init (CLEARED — byte-for-byte cap-1/2/3; code + commits are the live record)

`bringup.cold_bringup` is the canonical sequence (shared by the driver + `verify_pcap`). Two cycles —
`hal_read_mac_hidden_rpt` then the real `rtl8822b_hal_init` — reaching op ~9410:

- **chip-ID** `chipid.py`: `R 0xFC`/`0xF1` (chip 0x0A=8822B, cut 0x3=D); USB3 intf-phy param
  `{0x0001,0xA841}` → `W 0xFF0D/0E/0C` `[SRC] halmac_usb_8822b.c:107`; `R32 0xF0/0xF4/0x68`.
- **EFUSE** `efuse.py` (read up front, before power-on): driver-side dump (`R 0x0A` autoload,
  WIFI-bank `R 0x35`, the 1024-byte `0x30` poll loop), PG-header → 768 B logical map. Decoded:
  rfe_type **3** (iFEM), crystal_cap **0x2F**, channel_plan **0xa5**, MAC, PA-bias. The PG tx-power
  block @ logical **0x10** is decoded in `txpower.py` (see TXAGC).
- **MAC power-on** `mac.power_on` `[SRC] hal_halmac.c:2705`: pre_init_system_cfg (pin-mux, enable_bb_rf
  off), the `card_en_flow` pwr sequence (`pwrseq.py`, filtered by USB + cut BIT4), init_system_cfg.
  Poll loops consume the recorded reads (cap-3 polls `0x0005` one extra time — proof it's dynamic).
- **Firmware** `firmware.py`: morrownr `array_mp_8822b_fw_nic` v30.20 (161240 B, in
  `assets/rtl8822bu_fw.bin` — **not** the linux-firmware blob). `download_firmware_88xx`: txfifo gate,
  interleaved reg save/set, 40 BEACON-qsel rsvd-page TX packets (48-byte desc + XOR-16 cksum) on
  bulk-OUT 0x05 → iDDMA to MCU, FW-ready poll `0xC078`. Gate replays merged ctrl+bulk.
- **MAC init + FW-info** `mac.py`/`firmware.py`: init_trx_cfg (queue map, txff page math
  rsvd_boundary 1996), protocol/edca/wmac (RCR), send_general_info (2 H2C: FW boundary + PHYDM
  rfe/cut/rf/ant/package), dump_h2cq readback, reg-H2C, C2H report read+discard.
- **BB + RF tables** `bb.py`/`rf.py`/`phy_cond.py`: PRE/POST `0x808[28:29]` (no-op here), phy-reg
  (1492 rows), AGC (10684 rows, 328 cut/rfe conds → 521 selected for rfe 3), crystal cap → 0x24/0x28,
  RF-A (402) + RF-B (353) masked RF writes via `phy_cond.walk`. tx-pwr-track table is software-only.

## Post-PHY: full `odm_dm_init` (PORTED, ends op 9805) + TX-bf/coex/monitor + the per-channel scan

The capture past op 9410 is `odm_dm_init`, then (op 9805+) TX-beamforming + BT-coex + monitor MAC setup,
then (op ~9873+) the **per-channel cal scan** — the vendor pre-cals every channel ×2 bands (the captured
monitor + 2.4/5 GHz hops drive it via `set_channel`). **Lead decision: do NOT replay the scan — port the
per-channel unit once and run it on-demand from `set_channel`**, gated per-channel by `verify_channels`.

**DM init (`odm_dm_init` `[SRC] phydm.c:1789`) — PORTED in full** (`cal.py`, gate 9509→9805):
- *RX seed* (→9556): `halrf_init`(aac_check) → `rfe_init` → `common_info_self_init` (cck_setting +
  rf_path_rx + somlrxhp `0x19a8`) → `dig_init` (get_igi 0xC50, big_jump 0x8C8; `big_jump_step1` latched
  into `DmState`) → `cck_pd_init` (type1: 0xA0A=0x83) → `env_monitor_init` (ccx_hw_restart 0x994;
  nhm/clm/fahm — 11 thresholds `th[i]=((igi-14)<<1)+4i`) → `adaptivity_init` (EDCCA
  0x944/0x8a4/0x520/0x524) → `ra_info_init` (ARFR 0x494/0x498/0x4a4/0x4a8).
- *RF-cal tail* (→9805): `rssi_monitor_init`(sw no-op) → **`cfo_tracking_init`** (crystal-cap-by-WiFi
  `odm_set_mac_reg(0x10,0x40,1)`) → **`rf_init`** (tx-pwr-track init; `get_swing_index` reads
  `0xc1c[31:21]`) → **`dc_cancellation`** (`phydm.c:3496`, the RX DC-offset cal: per path A/B — stop
  TRX → IGI 0x7E → stop 3-wire → park debug-port 0x200/0x202 → stop ck320 → read `0xFA0` → restore;
  then CCK-path DC comp `0xA9C[20]` + per-path I/Q offsets to `0xC10/0xC14`,`0xE10/0xE14`) →
  **`tx_current_calibration`** (`phydm_rtl8822b.c:240`, TxA-bias: RF `0xef`=0x200 + 12× RF `0x18`
  sweep reading RF `0x61`, keyed by efuse `0x3D7/0x3D8`=`0xF0` ⇒ no RF `0x30` correction) →
  **`get_pa_bias_offset`** (`halrf_kfree.c`, PG PA-bias 0x3D5=0xF2/0x3D6=0xF0 → signed offset folded
  into RF `0x3f` via the `0xef`[10] LUT). Remaining tail inits (antdiv / soml / path_div / primary_cca /
  psd) are **wire-silent on 8822b** (verified each). `DmState` carries the few values whose *writes*
  derive from cached reads (dig IGI + big_jump_step1, cck_new_agc, dbg-port priority, stop_ic_trx s/r).

**Frontier op 9805 = TX-beamforming/MU-MIMO init** (`hal_txbf_8822b_init`: `0x14c0`/`0x167c`/`0x1680`/
`0x45f`/`0x1c94`), then **BT-coex HW init** + **monitor-mode MAC setup** (→~9872), then op ~9873 the
**per-channel cal scan**. None of 9805→9872 is in `cold_bringup` (see "Coverage gaps"). **No software
IQK runs anywhere** — `0x1b00` (the IQK engine) is in 0 of 29542 ops; IQK is FW-offloaded
`[SRC] hal_dm.c:75`. The per-channel kfree no-ops on this card (`phydm_config_kfree` early-returns:
power-trim PG blank), so the per-channel cal that *does* run is tx-power (ported) + FW-IQK (H2C, un-ported).

**RX status (HW): pending re-test with the ported `enable_monitor`.** The prior HW run showed 0
frames / 0 beacons with the driver's **ad-hoc** monitor RCR (`RCR`=0x9000380F, RXFLTMAP=0xFFFF) — but
`bulk_in` returned **0 bytes** (the HW wasn't DMA-ing RX to the bulk-IN at all). That ad-hoc path is now
replaced by the **vendor `enable_monitor`** (`set_opmode_monitor`, gate-verified 20/20 byte-for-byte), which
does what the ad-hoc path omitted: MSR no-link, `RCR`=**0x90000001** (not 0x9000380F),
**`config_rx_info(PHY_SNIFFER)`** (DRVINFO size 5 + `0x7d4[9]` sniffer bit), and **`REG_RX_DRVINFO_SZ`
|=0x80** (the DRVINFO-present flag). The missing DRVINFO/sniffer config is the prime RX-0 suspect: a
wrong RX-desc/DRVINFO size readily stalls the RX-DMA. In the capture, the first RX bulk-IN frame lands
the op *right after* this sequence. **Next: re-run `test_hw.py --phase beacon` on the card** (ask first
per the don't-auto-test-beacons rule) to see if the ported enter lights up RX. Proven solid: cold
init (full `rtl8822b_init`) byte-for-byte, and `rx.iter_frames` decoding all 9292 real capture frames
to valid beacons/probes (median -66 dBm) — so the rx_pkt_desc walk + phy-status parse are correct.

### Per-channel cal — in `set_channel`, gated by `verify_channels` (35/35/34 hops)

- **switch_channel** `chan.py`/`sipi.py`: RF18 channel + AGC `0x958` + clock `0x860` + CCK filter
  `0xA24/0xA28` + phase-noise `0xBE` + igi_toggle + ccapar (rfe-3 iFEM `0x82C/830/838`) + spur_reset.
  SIPI primitives: RF read = direct BB read at `{0x2800,0x2c00}[path]+(addr<<2)`; RF write packs
  `((addr&0xFF)<<20|data[19:0])` into `0xC90`/`0xE90`.
- **PSD spur eliminator — PORTED** (`chan._dynamic_spur_det_eliminate`): the read-dependent PSD sweep
  on spur channels (2.4G 5-8/13, 5G 153/161) + NBI notch (`0x87C`) + CSI notch (`0x880-0x89C` +
  `0x874[0]`). The replay feeds 0xF44, so the in-capture spur (ch6 PSD 0x197 ≥ 0x8D) drives the notch.
- **bandwidth** (`mac_switch_bandwidth` HALMAC cfg_ch_bw + `config_phydm_switch_bandwidth_8822b`,
  20 MHz) + **band switch** (both 2.4↔5 crossings; rfe-3 iFEM + SoML branch on `0x19a8[31]`).
- **TXAGC tx-power — PORTED** (`txpower.py`): `rtl8822b_set_tx_power_level` → per path × rate-section,
  `power_idx = phy_get_pg_txpwr_idx` (EFUSE PG base @ 0x10 + section/ntx BW20 diff), packed 4
  rates/dword at `0x1d00+(hw_rate&0xfc)`/`0x1d80`. **Byte-for-byte — build-config, not pcap-coincidence:
  the captured build sets `CONFIG_TXPWR_BY_RATE_EN=n` + `CONFIG_TXPWR_LIMIT_EN=n`
  `[SRC] driver-source/Makefile:130,132`** → by_rate folds to 0 (`phy_get_txpwr_target:5940`) and
  `phy_get_txpwr_lmt` early-returns → `power_idx = base`, **domain-independent** (verified base==wire,
  0 mismatches). PHY_REG_PG + the 7215-entry txpwr_lmt tables are inert in this build → correctly not
  ported. Caveat: no regulatory TX-power cap (matches the captured default).
- **Deferred per-channel cal:** after the ported retune + TXAGC, each hop runs **FW-IQK** (H2C image-
  rejection; 8822b has no software DPK) + the BT-coex band-notify. `verify_channels` lands `set_channel_bw`
  on that post-power boundary. Gate skips: the 2 band crossings (unported BT-coex `0xCBC` precedes TXAGC)
  + a few slice artifacts (window head lands mid-cal).

## Coverage gaps (verified one axis only)

- **`rtl8822b_init` tail (op 9815→9855) — now PORTED** (`txbf.py`/`coex.py`/`mac.init_misc`): the
  MU-MIMO/sounding seed (`phy_bf_init`: `0x14c0/0x167c/0x1680/0x45f/0x1c94`), the **wifi-only** coex
  antenna/RFE seed (`ex_hal8822b_wifi_only_hw_config`: `0x4c/0xcb4/0x974/0x1990/0xcbc/0x70` + gnt
  `0x1704/0x1700` — this dongle has `EEPROMBluetoothCoexist=false`, so the **full BT-coex stack is not
  in this capture** and is correctly not ported), and `init_misc` (CAM/RCR/sec-en/TXQ/AMPDU). MU-MIMO
  sounding/precoding itself only fires with TX+association (out of scope for passive RX).
- **OS interface-up / opmode (op 9855→9872) — driver-connect layer, un-ported.** `hw_var_set_opmode`
  (MSR/network-type, MAC addr from EFUSE `0x610/0x614`, beacon ctrl `0x550`, RX-filter `0x6a2`) is the
  mode-dependent (managed↔monitor) `WlanInterface`/connect() setup, not chip bring-up — a design-level
  port (Lead: discuss before execution). It is also the **RX-DMA/monitor-enable region** that is the
  candidate RX=0 blocker — to diff next when RX is chased. The per-channel **FW-IQK** (H2C,
  `[SRC] hal_dm.c:75` IQK offload) and the **aireplay-ng TX injection** (op 28910+, the gate's
  intentional stop — a different program's traffic) are likewise out of the chip-init gate.
- **per-channel kfree no-ops:** `phydm_config_kfree` early-returns on this card (power-trim PG blank,
  `!(pwrtrim->flag & KFREE_FLAG_ON)`), so the per-channel set_channel cal that runs is tx-power + FW-IQK,
  not kfree. (Distinct from the one-time `get_pa_bias_offset`, which *does* run — that's PG 0x3D5≠0xff.)
- **cap-2/3 from op ~9467:** `config_trx_mode`'s closing `phydm_rfe_8822b(central_ch_8822b)` is a
  no-op when the channel is 0 (or 15-35) but writes the iFEM table otherwise. `central_ch_8822b` is a
  **module global** `[SRC] phydm_hal_api8822b.c:34` set only by `config_phydm_switch_channel`; DM init
  runs before any channel switch, so it's 0 on the first cold boot (cap-1 — port reproduces it) but
  stale (ch 1, from the prior scan — the captures share a loaded module via unplug/replug, no rmmod)
  on cap-2/3, which emit the extra iFEM block and diverge. Benign cross-capture artifact → **cap-1 is
  authoritative from config_trx_mode on**. (The DM seed is identical on all 3 since `channel ≤ 14`.)
- **USB2-link branches** untested — all captures are USB3 (`REG_SYS_CFG2+3==0x20`
  `[SRC] halmac_usb_88xx.c:48`). The USB2 sides of `pre_init_system_cfg` `0xFE5B`, USB RXDMA/agg, and
  bulk-OUT sizing are source-ported-but-uncaptured.
- **Warm OFF→ON power cycle**: source-ported, no cold capture (cold boots return SUCCESS).

## Cleanroom rules

- Do **not** open `chips/rtl8822bu/`, `chips/rtw88_base/`, or `scripts/rtl8822bu/` (mainline + base +
  tooling — reading them produces a hybrid). The shared gate engine `scripts/rtw88_pcap_replay.py` is
  fine (family tooling, not driver code).
- Port from the **HALMAC + PHYDM (ODM)** vendor source. Sanctioned refs: that source + the sibling
  `chips/rtl8812au_dkms/`·`rtl8821au_dkms`·`rtl8814au_dkms` (a different HAL — expect new chip-local
  modules, not `rtw88_base`/`rtl88xxau_base` reuse).

## Gates + provenance

- **`verify_pcap.py rtl8822bu_dkms [<cap>]`** — replays `cold_bringup` vs the merged ctrl+bulk stream;
  prints reproduced-op count + `FRONTIER`. **`verify_channels.py <cap>`** — per-hop `set_channel_bw`
  diff (35/35/34). **`test_hw.py --phase open|init|beacon`** — live HW smoke. The engine feeds recorded
  reads back so read-dependent code reproduces; every write/bulk packet is byte-checked.
- Card: Archer T3U Plus v1 `2357:0138`, CUT_D, 2T2R, dual-band (Zadig→WinUSB on Windows; unbind kernel
  driver on Linux). Vendor: morrownr `rtl88x2bu` 5.13.1, source @
  `usb_dumps_new/captures_rtl88x2bu/driver-source/`. Captures: `capture-1/2/3.pcap` + `_logs/`
  (cold-boot, monitor, 2.4 then 5 GHz hops; `iw.log` has the per-channel `set channel` windows).

## Acceptance + working style

- Before "done": `planning/PORTING.md` § Post-Port Checklist (waiver review = zero waived init/airmon
  ops; skip audit = every un-emitted branch is a marked `# TODO untestable: <why>`; cap-1/2/3 coverage;
  async producers DIG/CCK-PD; per-hop recal + lock). Gate-green is necessary, not sufficient.
- Work inline in the main session (subagents only for parallel independent search). Gate + commit each
  milestone (one fn/commit, stage only your files, no AI trailer). Keep this doc current and concise
  with `[SRC]`/`[WIRE]` citations. TX `deauth_hw.py` is the human's trigger; the agent never
  live-injects.
