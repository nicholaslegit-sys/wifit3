# RTL8922AU (rtw89 8922A, USB)

Realtek RTL8922AU, 802.11be (WiFi 7), USB. Retail card in hand: ASUS USB-BE93 (`0b05:1d84`).
Standalone port from the rtw89 vendor source, no shared base. This doc is the handoff: status,
where the source and captures are, how to verify, and what to port next.

## Status

Cold-boot bring-up, first 9 register ops reproduced and committed:
- USB register-access transport (`rtw89_usb_vendorreq` + read/write ops + `read_cmac`).
- USB mode-switch (`rtw89_usb_switch_mode`, speed-branched) + `read_chip_ver`.

`verify_pcap` reproduces 9/162623 register ops. Frontier: op #18. Power-on, firmware download,
init, channel tune, and TX are not yet ported.

## Source

`/usr/src/rtw89-7.2` (morrownr rtw89 v7.2, installed via DKMS, persists across sessions). Port
from THIS, not from the mt7921au sibling in this tree (methodology forbids porting from a
sibling driver). Key files:
- `usb.c` the USB probe (`rtw89_usb_probe`), register access (`rtw89_usb_vendorreq`), mode
  switch (`rtw89_usb_switch_mode_be`).
- `core.c` `rtw89_read_chip_ver`, `rtw89_core_init` (the post-switch bring-up).
- `mac.c` `rtw89_mac_read_xtal_si_ax`, the power-on sequence.
- `reg.h` / `mac.h` register addresses and bitfields (paste verbatim, cite `file:line`).

`0b05:1d84` was added to `rtw8922au.c`'s id table so the kernel driver binds; the card runs as
a `wlan` interface under `rtw89_8922au_git` for hardware testing and re-captures later.

## Capture

`usb_dumps_new2/captures_rtw89_8922au_git/` (capture-1/2/3, cold boot). Taken on a USB-2 path:
`rtw89_usb_switch_mode` early-returns on SuperSpeed, so `switch_mode_be` reads `R_BE_PAD_CTRL2`
and the pcap opens with that read. Verify against all three per the methodology's step 6.

## Verify

    uv run python scripts/verify_pcap.py rtl8922au [capture]

One forward cursor over the device's VENQT control ops, driving the real `connect()`. Ops the
driver never emits (USB enumeration) are waived by name and logged, never dropped. It cannot
report PASS until every register op reproduces; on a mismatch it prints the frontier with a
10-before/after trace. `ReplayDev.speed = 3` (USB-2) so the mode-switch runs; a USB-C
(SuperSpeed) capture would set speed 4 and skip the `PAD_CTRL2` read. Only VENQT control ops
are walked so far. Extend `build_ops` for bulk-OUT (firmware chunks, TX) when the port reaches
them.

## Register access

A register op is a vendor control transfer on endpoint 0, `bRequest = 0x05` (`RTW89_USB_VENQT`),
`bmRequestType = 0xC0` read / `0x40` write. The address splits across the setup packet as
`wValue = addr & 0xFFFF`, `wIndex = (addr >> 16) & 0xFF`. [SRC] usb.c:31-32.

CMAC-window reads (`0xC000..0xFFFF`) can return `0xDEADBEEF` until the CMAC clock is enabled;
`read_cmac` re-enables it and re-reads. [SRC] usb.c:83-108. Indirect crystal-SI registers go
through `read_xtal_si` (write a command to `XTAL_SI_CTRL`, poll, read the data field).

## Next (from op 18)

op 18 reads `R_AX_GPIO_MUXCFG` (0x40); op 19/20 read then write `R_AX_SYS_PW_CTRL` (0x4). This
is the MAC power-on. Trace `rtw89_core_init` after `rtw89_read_chip_ver` into the power-switch
sequence (`rtw89_mac_pwr_on` / `rtw89_mac_power_switch`) and port it, then re-run verify: the
reproduced count should grow and the frontier advance. Port every branch behind its real
runtime check; a branch the 8922A cannot trigger is still ported, marked `# TODO: verify`.

## Style

Port from source, cite `file:line`. No milestone labels or status text in code (those live in
the commit message and this doc). Docstrings two lines or fewer, name things instead of
describing them, no jargon. No em-dashes and none of the banned words anywhere; see
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `docs/porting/CODE-STYLE.md`.

## Log

- 2026-07-26 M1: register-access transport + `Driver` subclass, full `rtw_8922au_id_table`.
- 2026-07-26 M2: USB mode-switch (USB-C/USB-2 speed branch) + `read_chip_ver`. 9 ops reproduced.
