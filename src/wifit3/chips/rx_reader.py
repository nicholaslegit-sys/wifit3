"""Shared RX reader thread for USB bulk-IN drivers.

Why this exists: reading + parsing RX on the asyncio event loop lets the TUI
starve RX — while the UI is busy, no `dev.read` is posted and the dongle's RX
FIFO overflows, dropping frames (~30% beacon loss / flaky handshakes; first
diagnosed + fixed per-chip on rtl8821au, commit 2e3a7a7). This class moves the
bulk reads onto a dedicated thread that keeps a read posted at all times,
independent of loop/UI load.

Composition, NOT a base class. Driver classes already have their own shape;
they differ only in *how they read* and *how they decode*, so each supplies
two callables:

  * ``read_once() -> bytes | None`` — one blocking bulk read; returns the raw
    buffer, or None on a benign timeout (no traffic). Runs ON THE READER
    THREAD. May raise on a real USB error (the reader counts consecutive
    errors and gives up after ``max_errors``).
  * ``dispatch(buf) -> None`` — decode the raw buffer into 802.11 frames and
    fan them to the driver's rx callback. Runs ON THE EVENT LOOP THREAD (via
    ``call_soon_threadsafe``), so it never races the UI's reads of the AP
    registry. The driver owns per-frame error handling.

The thread, the loop hand-off, a soft backpressure cap, and start/stop
lifecycle live here — once — so a fix or tweak (cap size, metrics, …) happens
in one place instead of N copy-pasted driver loops.
