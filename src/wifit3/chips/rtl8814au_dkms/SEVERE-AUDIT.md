# RTL8814AU_DKMS — Severe Audit (IN PROGRESS — next agent, start here)

> ## NEXT AGENT — START HERE
>
> **Goal: a byte-for-byte port of `rtl8814au_dkms`** (the morrownr 8814au vendor stack), to the point
> where a single-cursor `verify_pcap` reproduces the **entire** cold-boot capture byte-for-byte
> (every op matched, the only waiver being aireplay-ng's TX).
>
> **Cleanroom.** Port ONLY from `usb_dumps_new/captures_rtl8814au/driver-source/`. Do **NOT** open
> `chips/rtw88_8814au/` (mainline) or `chips/rtw88_base/` — reading them produces a hybrid. The
> shared replay engine `scripts/rtw88_pcap_replay.py` is fine (family tooling, not driver code).
>
> **You are autonomous — do not block on the user.** The rules are written down:
> `planning/PORTING.md` → **"The verify is one monotonic walk"** + **"The full-capture replay — the
> operating rules."** Read those first; they are the method. The card (ALFA AWUS1900, `0bda:8813`)
> is plugged in + WinUSB-bound — **run on hardware freely** (RX, channel tune, scan, 30-min soak).
> The **only** thing you may not do is **live 802.11 TX / injection / deauth** — that is the user's
> hands. Everything else: go. Whatever gets us to byte-for-byte.
>
> ### Mindset (load-bearing)
> **Assume the port does NOT match the wire — lazy, many ops skipped.** This session proved it (below).
> **Do not trust the port's comments** — *especially* any `skipped because X` / `no-op here` /
> `monitor dead-code` / `validated live` rationale, even when it sounds airtight. Treat every such
> comment as a **hypothesis to FALSIFY** against the vendor source + the wire. We have been burned
> exactly this way: `dig.py:17` says the watchdog is *"validated live, not via the byte-for-byte
> differ"* — and behind that comment was a **4-member gap**. The 8822bu's deaf 2.4 GHz hid behind a
> *"BT-coex no-op"* comment. Default-assume-wrong until silicon or source proves it.
>
 ### STATUS (session 4) — RX fix LIVE + HW-validated; only the RX-irrelevant halrf-LUT remains
> The single-cursor `verify_pcap` walks: init (efuse→turn-on, 7267 ops) → airmon STA→monitor dance
> (314) → operational dispatch of 3 interleaved producers (channel hops, LED blink, dynamic-check
> tick). It reproduces init + dance + **9 hops + 3 LED blinks + a FULL watchdog tick (every
> member)** and into tick #2, stopping at the **halrf TX-power thermal-delta correction** (the
> per-path swing LUT, 0xc94/0xc1c…) — the only remaining frontier. Gaps found + ported: airmon
> dance (G5-7), power-on check (G8), lagging-band CCK skip (G9), LED (G10), sreset+FA-stats+DIG-
> carry (G11), dbg-port (G4), adaptivity (G2), halrf re-arm (G12 partial), **env_mntr NHM/CLM (G3)**.
>
> **The driver is MIGRATED to `watchdog.tick` and the RX dropout fix is HW-validated.** The runtime
> watchdog now runs the full tick (DIG-carry + adaptivity + CCX env-monitor) carrying state, so the
> IGI + EDCCA thresholds ADAPT instead of freezing at the seed. `scan_hw` confirmed: RX healthy
> (44 APs/25 s) and the watchdog visibly adapts — IGI climbs 0x22→0x2a as false-alarms spike, then
> holds at 0x2a as FA settles to ~3000.
>
> **30-min 2.4 GHz soak — DROPOUT FIXED.** `scan_hw --duration 1800` (2.4 GHz hop): **85 APs,
> 51,128 beacons over 30 min**, and the aggregate beacon rate holds **rock-steady at ~26–32/s for
> the whole 30 minutes with zero decay** (per-~3-min windows: 28.4 → 27.8 → 30.1 → 28.6 → 31.6 →
> 26.3 → 25.2 → 27.1 → 31.6/s). The sustained 2.4 GHz RX that the frozen-watchdog port lacked is
> now stable — the adapting DIG + adaptivity + CCX maintain it across the full soak.
>
> ### REMAINING
> 1. **The gate's last frontier — halrf G12 (TX-power thermal-delta correction).** `watchdog._halrf`
>    reproduces the thermal re-arm (no-delta path) but NOT the per-path swing/OFDM-index correction
>    [SRC halphyrf_ce.c odm_txpowertracking_callback_thermal_meter — thermal averaging buffer +
>    odm_get_tracking_table LUT + per-path power_index_offset → 0xc94/0xc1c…]. It is TX-power thermal
>    compensation, **RX-irrelevant**, so it is gate-completeness only; the driver's RX path is
>    unaffected and the runtime watchdog correctly no-ops it. Port it (large + stateful) to reach a
>    100% gate, OR add it to the driver only if sustained TX-power accuracy over long sessions matters.
> 2. **G1 `phydm_cck_pd_th`** [phydm_cck_pd.c:1019] — carries `cck_fa_ma`; writes 0x0a0a only on a
>    threshold change (4× total). Goes between `_dig` and `_adaptivity` in the tick (currently a no-op
>    on the wire ticks reproduced so far; will surface at the first 0x0a0a write).
>
> ### How it was built (reference, steps 1+2 of the original plan — DONE)
> The current `scripts/rtl8814au_dkms/verify_pcap.py` IS the single-cursor gate (replaced the
> windowed anti-pattern). Reference shape was `scripts/rtl8188eus_dkms/verify_pcap.py`. Walk the
> vendor source using the gate's frontiers: each unaccounted op the cursor stops on names the next
> thing to port (gap) or make consistent with the wire (inconsistency).

## What this session found (don't re-derive — start from here)

### The current gate is the windowed anti-pattern
`scripts/rtl8814au_dkms/verify_pcap.py`:
- **Windowed** to frames `(5707, 30000)` — but **the capture runs to frame 85279.** ~55k frames
  (the whole runtime-watchdog phase) are outside the window entirely.
- **Stops at M3b-1**: reproduces 4451 ops (cold init → hal_init turn-on tail), then halts; ~7105
  ops *within its own window* (61%) are never replayed. No waivers are *named* — it just stops.
- **Slices the monitor entry** into an isolated 10-op block (`verify_monitor_block`), out of context.
- **Waives the airmon STA→monitor dance** (silently) — the new rule says reproduce it.
- **Never gates the watchdog.** `verify_channels.py` covers per-hop tunes only; the periodic
  watchdog ticks are byte-verified by nothing.

### CONFIRMED un-ported chunk: the runtime watchdog (prime 2.4 GHz dropout suspect)
`dig.py:watchdog_tick` runs **only** `phydm_dig` (FA→IGI). The vendor `phydm_watchdog`
[SRC phydm.c:1828-2226] runs every tick, additionally:

| Vendor member | Reg(s) | Our state |
|---|---|---|
| `phydm_dig` (FA→IGI) | 0xc50/e50/1850/1a50 | ✅ ported |
| `phydm_cck_pd_th` | 0xa0a | ❌ **seed-only** at init (`dm._cck_pd_init`), never updated — **2.4-GHz-specific** |
| `phydm_adaptivity` | 0x8a4 | ❌ seed-only (`dm._adaptivity_init`) |
| `phydm_env_mntr_watchdog` | 0x994 | ❌ seed-only (`dm._env_monitor_init`) |
| dynamic antenna-weighting | 0x98c/0x198c | ❌ **not ported at all** (we disable MRC ant-sel at init, `dm.py:46`) — **4T4R RX, the runtime analog of the 8822bu antenna-mux bug** |

The capture proves the vendor re-runs these at runtime: **347× `0x994`, 108× `0x8a4`, 216×
`0x198c`** in the operational tail (frames 15247-85279), none reproduced by us. **CCK-PD** (CCK
doesn't exist on 5 GHz — which is exactly why only 2.4 GHz drops) and **antenna-weighting** (4T4R)
are the two prime dropout suspects. **But this is the gap we KNOW** — build the full gate to find
the ones we don't, then fix the whole set together.

## Coordinates
- Card: ALFA AWUS1900, RTL8814AU **4T4R**, `0bda:8813`. Efuse (cap-1): `rfe_type=1`, `crystal_cap=0x23`.
- Captures: `usb_dumps_new/captures_rtl8814au/capture-{1,2,3}.pcap` — dev addr `{51, 53, 54}`. The
  airmon/FW-load phase starts ~frame 5707; capture-1 runs to **frame 85279**. `<cap>_logs/iw.log`
  has the per-channel `set channel` windows (use these to slice the hops; see PORTING.md airodump rule).
- Vendor source: `usb_dumps_new/captures_rtl8814au/driver-source/` (morrownr 8814au 5.8.5.1).
- Port: `src/wifit3/chips/rtl8814au_dkms/` — handlers: `firmware.bring_up`, `mac.phy_mac_config`/
  `mac_init_misc`/`hal_init_turn_on`, `bb.phy_bb_config`, `rf.phy_rf_config`, `chan.init_tune`/
  `set_channel_bw`/`set_rfe_reg_init`, `dm.init_hal_dm`, `dig.watchdog_tick`, `monitor.enter_monitor`,
  `efuse.read_chip_params`, `rx.iter_frames`.
- Gates: `scripts/rtl8814au_dkms/verify_pcap.py` (windowed anti-pattern — REPLACE), `verify_channels.py`
  (per-hop, sliced — FOLD into the single cursor), `verify_efuse_pcap.py` (probe efuse read).
- HW smoke: `scripts/rtl8814au_dkms/{test_hw,scan_hw,ab_scan}.py`.

## Session 2 progress — the single-cursor gate is built; airmon dance + 2 hidden gaps ported

`scripts/rtl8814au_dkms/verify_pcap.py` is now a **single monotonic cursor** over the whole
capture (anchor = the probe chip-version read; no window, no aireplay waiver — this capture has
**no injection**, every bulk-OUT is an FW packet). It walks: init (efuse → turn-on tail, 7267
ops) → **airmon STA→monitor dance** (314 ops, reproduced not waived) → operational dispatch
(hop = `R 0x0454`, tick = `R 0x0060`). It currently reproduces init + dance + the first hop and
stops at the **first watchdog tick** (`R 0x0060` @ op 7868 / frame 15933) — the FA→IGI-only
`dig.watchdog_tick` can't reproduce a full tick. **That is the live frontier.** `verify_channels.py`
is **folded into the cursor** (deleted); per-hop tunes are now dispatched in-context with carried
band state.

Building the gate surfaced two gaps the windowed anti-pattern hid (G8, G9 below) — exactly the
PORTING.md warning that a windowed gate is blind between its windows.

### The watchdog tick, fully decoded + de-risked (the remaining work = the dropout fix)

**The whole operational tail IS wire-reproducible** — confirmed by reading every member's
source. Every write is either a function of a replayed HW read or of carried deterministic SW
state (LED phase, cck_fa_ma, adaptivity/CCX state). The one wall-clock gate (env_mntr's
`phydm_nhm_mntr_chk` line 1162) is **bypassed for NHM_BACKGROUND** — its branch is driven by
`phydm_nhm_get_result` (a HW read). So a **100% single-cursor gate over the whole capture is
achievable**; there is no genuine non-reproducible op (this capture has no aireplay TX either).

**The LED (`0x0060`) is a SEPARATE producer, not the tick.** `dm_DynamicUsbTxAgg` is a **no-op
on 8814AU** [SRC hal_com.c:13787 — only the 8821U/8812/HALMAC branches write]. `0x0060` is the
USB LED blink [SRC rtl8814au_led.c `SwLedOn_8814AU`/`SwLedOff_8814AU`]: a strict ON/OFF
alternation starting ON. ON = `read32(0x60) | 0x630000 & ~0x6300 & ~0x63`; OFF =
`read32 | 0x630000 | 0x6300`. Reproduce by **dispatching `R 0x0060` separately** with a carried
1-bit phase (start ON). 212 ops total. The driver itself need not blink the LED (cosmetic, no RX
effect) — but the gate must account for it.

**The dynamic-check tick** opens on `R 0x0210` (= `rtl8814_sreset_xmit_status_check` reading
REG_TXDMA_STATUS; monitor has no TX so it only reads `0x0210` + `0x0288`). Then
`rtw_hal_dm_watchdog` → **`phydm_watchdog`** [SRC phydm.c:2162]. Per-tick wire ops, in order,
with measured capture-1 counts (operational phase, ÷54 ticks):

| phydm member | [SRC] | wire ops / tick | total W | carried state | port note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `phydm_fa_cnt_statistics_ac` | phydm_dig.c (called from 1576) | 13 reads (0x0fcc/0fd0/0fbc/0fc0/0fc4/0fc8/0f48/0a5c/0f08/0f04/0f14/0f10/0f0c) + 0x0808 | 0 | — | port full FA/CCA read set (we read only cnt_all today) |
| `phydm_get_dbg_port_info` | phydm_dig.c:1580 | 0x198c/0x8fc/0xfa0/0x8f8 (~16) | — | — | **this is G4, NOT antenna-weighting** — BB debug-port read |
| `phydm_false_alarm_counter_reg_reset` | phydm_dig.c | 0x09a4/0a2c/0b58 (12) | 134/108/108 | — | already in `dig._reset_fa_cnt` |
| `phydm_dig` | phydm_dig.c:1085 | IGI 0xc50/e50/1850/1a50 (conditional) | 22 each | igi (re-read each tick) | core ported; verify full path |
| `phydm_cck_pd_th` | phydm_cck_pd.c:1019 | 0x0a0a **only 4× total** (not every tick) | 4 | `cck_fa_ma` | mostly no-op on wire; G1 "every tick" was WRONG |
| `phydm_adaptivity` → `phydm_edcca_thre_calc` | phydm_adaptivity.c:768 | 0x08a4 ×2 (L2H+H2L) | 108 | adaptivity th | **writes every tick** — frozen at seed today (G2, prime suspect) |
| `halrf_watchdog` | halrf | 0x0440(1×) + 0x2908(R, 54×) + 0x0c90 | 1 | thermal/IQK | minor |
| `phydm_env_mntr_watchdog` | phydm_ccx.c:1989 | 0x0994 + 0x0fb4/0990/0998/099c/09a0 | 347 | CCX NHM/CLM | **heaviest; writes every tick** — frozen at seed today (G3, prime suspect) |

**Dropout fix = make adaptivity (G2) + env_mntr (G3) re-run at runtime** (they write every tick
in the kernel; our port seeds them once at init and never updates → EDCCA + CCX/NHM thresholds
freeze). DIG (0xc50) already adapts. cck_pd (G1) barely writes. Port plan: build the full tick
orchestrator (LED dispatch + sreset + the phydm members above, in order), carry the small DM
state structs, gate-confirm the cursor advances op-by-op through one tick — once one full tick
reproduces it should sail to capture end (the members are stateless-or-carried + HW-read-driven).

## Known gaps ledger (verdict = ported / fixed / proven-matching / waived-named)

| # | Op / area (wire landmark) | Vendor [SRC] | Our state | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G5 | airmon STA→monitor dance (RX-BAR + retune + STA-opmode + monitor) | hal_com.c:12384 / rtl8814a_hal_init.c:3204 | reproduced single-cursor | **PORTED (monitor.py + driver connect)** |
| G6 | monitor entry verified out-of-context (10-op slice) | — | dispatched inline | **FIXED (single cursor)** |
| G7 | frames 30000-85279 outside the gate window | — | cursor walks to capture end | **FIXED (single cursor)** |
| G8 | `_mac_power_on_check` (R 0x09/0x100) before _InitPowerOn | usb_halinit.c:1073 | hidden by the windowed gate; now reproduced | **PORTED (firmware.bring_up)** — falsified the "hw_reset is #if 0 ⇒ no preamble ops" assumption |
| G9 | CCK txagc skipped on band-uncommitted 2.4G tunes (lagging `current_band_type`) | hal_com_phycfg.c:3044 | port always wrote CCK on 2.4G | **PORTED (chan band-state + txpower write_cck)** — windowed gate never saw the airmon retune/hops |
| G1 | watchdog `phydm_cck_pd_th` (0xa0a) | phydm_cck_pd.c:1019 | seed-only at init | **gap — port (only 4 writes total on the wire, NOT every tick; carries `cck_fa_ma`)** |
| G2 | watchdog `phydm_adaptivity` → `phydm_edcca_thre_calc` (0x8a4) | phydm_adaptivity.c:513 | seed-only | **PORTED (watchdog._adaptivity): NORMAL branch th_l2h=max(igi+8,48), th_h2l=th_l2h-8; tracks carried IGI. Gate-verified** |
| G3 | watchdog `phydm_env_mntr_watchdog` (0x994) | phydm_ccx.c:1989 | seed-only | **PORTED (watchdog._env_mntr): NHM/CLM get-result-when-ready + re-arm + triggers; IGI-derived NHM th carried; CCX state seeded from InitHalDm. Gate-verified across tick #1. Telemetry, not the RX fix** |
| G4 | watchdog FA-stats `phydm_get_dbg_port_info` (0x198c/0x8fc/0xfa0/0x8f8) | phydm_dig.c:1525 | — | **PORTED (watchdog._get_dbg_port_info): BB debug-port clock-en/sel/val/header cycle ×2 (G4's "antenna-weighting" guess was WRONG)** |
| G10 | LED blink (0x0060) — SEPARATE producer, NOT `dm_DynamicUsbTxAgg` (a no-op on 8814AU) | rtl8814au_led.c | — | **PORTED (watchdog.led_blink): dispatched separately on `R 0x0060`, carried ON/OFF phase. Gate-verified** |
| G11 | tick wrapper sreset polls (R 0x0210/0x0288) + `phydm_fa_cnt_statistics_ac` full FA/CCA reads + DIG carry-state | rtl8814a_sreset.c:21 / phydm_dig.c:1085 | — | **PORTED (watchdog._sreset/_fa_cnt_statistics/_dig): 14 FA/CCA reads; DIG now carries `cur_ig_value` (seeded from InitHalDm) instead of re-reading 0xc50, so unchanged-IGI ticks emit no ops. Gate-verified IGI 0x20→0x22** |
| G12 | watchdog `halrf_watchdog` → `odm_txpowertracking_check` thermal re-arm (0x0440/2908/0c90) | halphyrf_ce.c:1151 | **PARTIAL (watchdog._halrf): no-delta re-arm only** | **the THERMAL-DELTA per-path TX-power correction (0xc94/0xc1c… swing LUT) is unported — the gate's last frontier (tick #2). TX-power compensation, RX-irrelevant** |

**Watchdog port status:** `watchdog.py` reproduces a FULL dynamic-check tick (LED + sreset + nbi-switch
+ fa-stats + dbg-port + fa-reset + DIG-carry + adaptivity + halrf-rearm + env_mntr), gate-verified
single-cursor across tick #1 + 9 hops. The gate's only remaining frontier is the halrf TX-power
thermal-delta correction (tick #2, RX-irrelevant). **The driver IS migrated** to `watchdog.tick` (the
RX dropout fix — adapting IGI/EDCCA/CCX — is live + HW-validated: 44 APs, IGI 0x22→0x2a then holds).
