"""Reproduces the Focus-entry channel-tune race on MT7610U (mt76x0u): two tunes running
concurrently on the USB device.

Root cause (proven from wifit3.log @ 02:54:29.9): entering Focus stops channel hopping, but
``stop_hopping``'s ``await task`` returns while the cancelled hop tune's ``run_in_executor``
thread is still draining ``set_channel_20mhz`` on the control endpoint. Focus's ``set_channel``
then spawns a second thread; the two interleave their RF/BBP register batches and the chip
lands on a corrupt channel ("0 beacons until you re-enter Focus"). Same class as the rt3070
RX-DMA wedge — fixed the same way, with a ``threading.Lock`` held by the executor work.

No hardware: ``set_channel_20mhz`` is stubbed with a thread-concurrency counter. Run from two
threads it overlaps (>=2); through ``driver._set_channel_sync`` (which holds ``_hw_lock``) it
serializes (==1).
