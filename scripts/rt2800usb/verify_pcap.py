"""Acceptance gate: replay-diff rt2800usb (Ralink RT3572 / RT5372 / RT5572) bring-up blocks
against its cold-boot capture.

Drives the port's real ``RT2800USBTransport`` around a ``rt2x00_pcap_replay.ReplayDevice``
(a fake usb dev that replays the chip's recorded ctrl_transfers), so the port's real helpers
run unchanged and must emit byte-identical writes or a Divergence is raised at the first
mismatch.

This is an *anchored-block* verifier (not the single-cursor whole-capture walk the clean-room
ports use): each block is extracted from the capture by an anchor predicate and replayed in
isolation, so coverage grows block by block without re-porting the whole driver. Blocks:

  * [EFUSE walk]      the 32-iteration EFUSE read loop (``read_eeprom_efuse``), anchored on
                      the first EFUSE_CTRL touch. Catches the ADDRESS_IN byte-vs-word bug.
  * [firmware upload] the rt2870.bin USB half (4096 bytes streamed to FIRMWARE_IMAGE_BASE
                      over 64-byte chunked control writes), anchored at the first chunk.

Known divergence flagged for a separate session: the full ``load_firmware`` preamble opens
with ``write32(AUTOWAKEUP_CFG, 0)``, which this USB capture never issues -- that write is
PCI/SoC-only in rt2800lib.c, so the USB port should skip it. The blob upload below is
verified independently of that preamble.

Counter (2026-06-10): the "PCI/SoC-only" reading above is falsified -- ``rt2800lib.c:731``
writes ``AUTOWAKEUP_CFG`` *unconditionally*, above the ``is_pci`` guard (which holds only
``AUX_CTRL``/``PWR_PIN_CFG``). So the write matches the kernel and gating it out would be a
regression. The remaining open question is the wire-absence claim itself -- which this
*anchored-block* verifier can't settle, since it never replays the preamble. A single-cursor
full-walk would.
